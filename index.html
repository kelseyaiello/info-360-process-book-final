			<h1>Preface: What is Design?</h1>
				<p>On the first day of class I walked into that initial lecture with my preconceived notions about what I thought design was. To me, design was basically just drawing sketches, making graphics and maybe occasional app development. While it is true that design does in fact encompass all of these things, it also goes a lot deeper than I imagined. At its most fundamental level,<strong> design is problem solving.</strong> Design is taking a problem people might not even realize they have and thinking up a solution to that problem through brainstorming, user research, prototyping, testing, revision, and finally implementation. The process of design thinking is so much more complex than my initial expectations. Being able to go through that whole process from start to finish is something I will be able to reflect back on and use in my future career.</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>This process book tells the story about my first experience going through the full design thinking process from start to finish. Given a very opened ended prompt and a mere <strong>ten weeks</strong>, my two other collegues and I were presented with the task to design something that would help solve a problem that University of Washington students face today. The central theme was <strong>surviving college.</strong> The probelm we would be trying to tackle was completely up to our discretion. In fact, we would spend the first few of weeks of class deciding on, narrowing down and carefully crafting the exact problem that we were trying to solve. </p>

			<h1>Step One: Choosing the Problem</h1>
				<p>Our design problem had its beginnings rooted in an area that I personally find to be an extremely interesting and practical application of informatics, <strong>personal health</strong>. That being said, it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that I pitched a health related idea for a design problem. My idea was to design an application of some sort that would help students with chronic illnesses manage their health more easily and effectively.  Fortunately my fellow group members were also keen of the direction I was trying to go. However there was one issue with this idea&mdash;it was actually a solution rather than a problem. One of the most challenging tasks to do during this first stage was to focus on <strong>brainstorming problems rather than skipping ahead to thinking of solutions</strong>. After a few iterations of trying to hone in on what exactly we wanted to solve, we came up with a general idea. We thought it would be beneficial to try to find a way to help UW students with dietary restrictions find new food they could safety consume around the U-district in an effortless and more accurate way. However, it actually wasn&#39;t until much user research later that we were able to precisely articulate the exact problem we wanted to solve.</p>

			<h1>Step Two: Gaining Insight Through User Research</h1>
			<p>In my opinion, one of the most important parts of our design process was figuring out the needs of our target audience. We conducted interviews with fellow classmmates and friends with dietary restrictions. From here is when we were able to begin accurately determining the most significant problems facing students with dietary restrictions. During this phase I found it easy to get trapped into making assumptions on what the user&#39;s needs would be based off of what I thought my own wants and needs would be. However, that was not necessarily the best approach. It was crucial to remember that people are very multidimensional and, more importantly, <strong>&ldquo;the user is not like me!&rdquo;</strong> By the end of our interviews we were able to determine which of our initial assumptions about the challenges students with dietary restrictions face were accurate and which were dismissed as irrelevant. </p>

			<h1>Step Three: Brainstorming Solutions and Initial Prototyping</h1>
			<p><strong>Quantity:</strong> that was the main focus of this step. The goal was to get as many ideas for our solution out of our heads on onto paper as possible.  Between the three of us we generated about 120 possible designs for our solution, give or take a few overlapping ideas. These ideas ranged from bizarre inventions such as robots that cook for you and gluten detectors to simple informational posters and mobile applications. In the end we narrowed it down to the three finalists: a website, a mobile app, and a universal menu /bracelet labeling system. At this point in the process I felt the most comfortable coming up with the design for our mobile app. I used Yelp! as a base model for my design and branched off from there, giving the app the dietary customizations I wanted to see inplemented in it. Though it was a close competition, the design that my group decided to go with was the <strong>mobile app</strong>. This is where we began to run into some tougher decisions. Initially we wanted our app to take into account every common dietary restriction, and grant users the power to customize the app even more towards their unique preferences. While this idea seemed great at first, my group mates and I quickly came to realize how much work this would actually entail to pull off successfully in our short ten week class span. We had to narrow our scope down to something more feasible for our limited abilities and resources. After some dilberation, we decided to focus our efforts on an app targeted to <strong>gluten intolerant</strong> and <strong>Celiac</strong> indivduals. I thought that designing for Celiac individuals on top of just gluten-intolerant individuals would be best because of the health risk that is associated with Celiac. If our app could potentially keep its users <strong>safer</strong> by directing them to not only gluten-free food options but also Celiac-safe options, than I think that would be a very worthwhile use of our efforts. The first name I gave our app was GlutenFreeBuddy. </p>

			<h1>Step Four: High Fidelity Prototyping</h1>
				<p>It was finally time to bring our designs to life with <strong>high fidelity</strong> prototypes. I took the lead on the design of the prototypes, as my group early on appointed me in charge of graphic design and &ldquo;making things pretty&rdquo;, as they would say. We used a program called Sketch to make all of our prototypes and boy was it a lot more <strong>time consuming and tedious</strong> than I had anticipated. Although the program was fairly easy to pick up, changing even the most minor details on a screen would take forever. Our first item on the checklist was to pick a color scheme. Taking into account the color preferences from my two other group members as well as my own, I came up with the color scheme of (roughly) peach, navy, tan, and white. Keeping Yelp! in mind as a design basis for my prototypes, I created my screens. Through more <strong>user testing and critique</strong>, the designs slowly began to evolve into their final looks. We took out some initial features we had wanted to include in the app for example a social media aspect where users could connect with their friends and share restaurants via the app. After testing our app out with our collegues, the general concensus was that the social media aspect made it feel like the app was trying to do too much. Instead, we added a feature where the user can share restaurants via SMS text messages or email. This is a simplier and more appealing way of doing virtually the same task, according to our user testers. We also went with a different name for the app, <strong>GlutenAid</strong>. While I think we could still think of a little better, more intuitive name for our app, GlutenAid looked and sounded the best with what we were working with. Even through <strong>many rounds of iteration</strong>, my screens didn't deviate too far from their original look and feel.  Below are some of the main screens I took the lead on designing with my first iterations on the left and the final screens on the right.</p>

			<h1>Step Five: Video Storyboarding and Prototyping</h1>
				<p>One of the key things to learn when you have a great idea you want to share with others is knowing how to effective protray that idea. The way we attempted to do such a protrayal is through a video prototype. The goal of a video prototype is to <strong>persuade.</strong> The focus should be on making sure everything you love about your idea is conveyed in the way you mean it to be conveyed. This is definitely easier said than done as my group experienced first hand. I took charge of drawing out the storyboard while the other members in my group typed up the script, or what should be going on in each scene. Our initial script and storyboards did not include any narration. We wanted to <strong>convey the different moods</strong> in our video with music, lighting, and camera angles. However, with no one in my group being especially gifted at videography or acting, we found it difficult to convey our message adequately through film without having either blatant narration or text. Nonetheless, I think in the end we found our <strong>happy medium</strong> by adding the right music and including just enough text to let the viewer know it is going on. </p>

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In just a mere ten short weeks, my group mates and I were able to take a vague, open-ended design problem and tailor it to a specific group of people and design a solution that seems <strong>feasible, useful, and well thought out.</strong> The process of design thinking is a complex one to say the least. As the problem evolved over time, so did our potential solutions and goals of our project. Nevertheless, at the end of all the madness I now have a tangible project I can show to future employers that I am proud of. And that makes it all worth it.</p>
